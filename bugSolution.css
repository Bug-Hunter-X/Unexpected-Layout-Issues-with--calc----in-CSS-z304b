To fix this, ensure the parent element has an explicitly defined width. If the parent element's width is dynamic, consider using viewport units (`vw`) or other flexible units instead of percentages within the `calc()` function.  For example, you might replace `width: calc(100% - 10px);` with `width: calc(100vw - 10px);` to ensure proper calculation regardless of the parent's width.
